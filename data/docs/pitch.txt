Pitch it to the hiring manager

Problem: “Enable customers to ask questions about their statements, fees, and policies.”

Solution: RAG app with LLMs + VectorDB; upload statements, grounded answers with citations.

Stack: PyTorch, Transformers (FLAN-T5), SentenceTransformers (all-MiniLM-L6-v2), FAISS, Streamlit.

Scaling path: swap local generator for AWS Bedrock or Hugging Face Inference; store artifacts in S3; containerize via Docker, deploy on ECS/EKS; add guardrails and telemetry.

Screenshots + short Loom walkthrough recommended.

If you want, I can also provide:

A Dockerfile and Makefile,

An AWS deploy variant (S3/ECR/ECS),

A short one-pager or slide deck to email with the demo.
